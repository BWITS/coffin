- dependency declaration
  - possibly allow resources to depend on eachother directly and do the wait condition/handle stuff implicitly
- prettier Mapping usage (instead of FindInMap)
  - @AWS.EC2.Instance
      ImageId: @Mappings.AWSRegionArch2AMI['us-east-1']['32']
- add simple description support (as it exists on Param) for all resource types (the ones that support descriptions anyway)

  - @GetAtt 'MyResource', 'MyProperty' 
    becomes
    @Resource.MyResource.MyProperty
- prettier @Join handling for multiple lines (for UserData scripts and such)
- watch support for coffin command line
- integration with cloudformation command line tools
 - create/update via command line flag
 - todo: when running a cfn command, just build a tempfile and run
  - instead of requiring an output file
- better error reporting
