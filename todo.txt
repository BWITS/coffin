- dependency declaration
  - possibly allow resources to depend on eachother directly and do the wait condition/handle stuff implicitly
- prettier Mapping usage (instead of FindInMap)
  - @AWS.EC2.Instance
      ImageId: @Mappings.AWSRegionArch2AMI['us-east-1']['32']
- add simple description support (as it exists on Param) for all resource types (the ones that support descriptions anyway)
- simplify GetAtt functions by putting properties on Resources
  - @GetAtt 'MyResource', 'MyProperty' 
    becomes
    @Resource.MyResource.MyProperty
- coffin command should watch long-running statuses and terminate when complete
- better error reporting
- fix the weird . path thing

- instead of relying on the cfn-tools, just call the rest api directly

- simple templating for cloud-init scripts
