- dependency declaration
  - possibly allow resources to depend on eachother directly and do the wait condition/handle stuff implicitly
- mappings
- flesh out all 
- add simple description support (as it exists on Param) for all resource types (the ones that support descriptions anyway)
- simplify GetAtt functions by putting properties on Resources
  - @GetAtt 'MyResource', 'MyProperty' 
    becomes
    @Resource.MyResource.MyProperty
